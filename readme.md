My dotfiles, managed with help of
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), strongly inspired by this
post: [Managing your dotfiles](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

Folder structure:
- Vim: setting for vim.
-

Goal:
- Make the setup steps on another machine become easier.
- Share common setting between bash and zsh, as the default shell is always bash, and for some machine, that's not easy to install zsh.
