My dotfiles, managed with help of
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), strongly inspired by this
post: [Managing your dotfiles](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)


**NOTE** This works for me, but maynot work for you. Take your own risk.

Goal

- Essential softwares should work on window: git, zsh, vim.
- Get rid of external dependencies (dotbot in this case)
- Fast.
