My dotfiles, managed with help of
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), strongly inspired by this
post: [Managing your dotfiles](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

Goal:
- Cross platform:
  - Window 8 and window 10.
  - Mac OS X.
  - Linux system: include Debian based (Ubuntu) and RPM based (KDE)
- Share common setting between bash and zsh, as the default shell is always bash, and for some machine, that's not easy to install zsh.
