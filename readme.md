Dotfiles
========

My dotfiles, managed with help of
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), strongly inspired by this
post: [Managing your dotfiles](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

**NOTE* This works for me, but maynot work for you. Take your own risk. You can

Vim
---

I'm try hard to reduce at much as possible the list of vim plugins I'm using,
yet I keep experience with new stuff, while compare them with built-in vim
feature (if it has one). Following plugins is what I feel essential.
