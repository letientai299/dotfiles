.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ripgrep (rg) combines the usability of The Silver Searcher (an ack
clone) with the raw speed of grep.
.PP
ripgrep\[aq]s regex engine uses finite automata and guarantees linear
time searching.
Because of this, features like backreferences and arbitrary lookaround
are not supported.
.PP
Note that ripgrep may abort unexpectedly when using default settings if
it searches a file that is simultaneously truncated.
This behavior can be avoided by passing the \-\-no\-mmap flag.

.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-text
Search binary files as if they were text.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-count
Only show count of line matches for each file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-color \f[I]WHEN\f[]
Whether to use color in the output.
Valid values are never, auto, always or ansi.
The default is auto.
When always is used, coloring is attempted based on your environment.
When ansi is used, coloring is forcefully done using ANSI escape color
codes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-regexp \f[I]PATTERN\f[] ...
Use PATTERN to search.
This option can be provided multiple times, where all patterns given are
searched.
This is also useful when searching for patterns that start with a dash.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-glob \f[I]GLOB\f[] ...
Include or exclude files for searching that match the given glob.
This always overrides any other ignore logic if there is a conflict, but
is otherwise applied in addition to ignore files (e.g., .gitignore or
\&.ignore).
Multiple glob flags may be used.
Globbing rules match .gitignore globs.
Precede a glob with a \[aq]!\[aq] to exclude it.
.RS
.PP
The \-\-glob flag subsumes the functionality of both the \-\-include and
\-\-exclude flags commonly found in other tools.
.PP
Values given to \-g must be quoted or your shell will expand them and
result in unexpected behavior.
.PP
Combine with the \-\-files flag to return matched filenames (i.e., to
replicate ack/ag\[aq]s \-g flag).
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rg\ \-g\ \[aq]*.foo\[aq]\ \-\-files
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show this usage message.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-ignore\-case
Case insensitive search.
Overridden by \-\-case\-sensitive.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-line\-number
Show line numbers (1\-based).
This is enabled by default at a tty.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-no\-line\-number
Suppress line numbers.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Do not print anything to stdout.
If a match is found in a file, stop searching that file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-type \f[I]TYPE\f[] ...
Only search files matching TYPE.
Multiple type flags may be provided.
Use the \-\-type\-list flag to list all available types.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-type\-not \f[I]TYPE\f[] ...
Do not search files matching TYPE.
Multiple not\-type flags may be provided.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-unrestricted ...
Reduce the level of \[aq]smart\[aq] searching.
A single \-u doesn\[aq]t respect .gitignore (etc.) files.
Two \-u flags will search hidden files and directories.
Three \-u flags will search binary files.
\-uu is equivalent to \f[C]grep\ \-r\f[], and \-uuu is equivalent to
\f[C]grep\ \-a\ \-r\f[].
.RS
.PP
Note that the \-u flags are convenient aliases for other combinations of
flags.
\-u aliases \-\-no\-ignore.
\-uu aliases \-\-no\-ignore \-\-hidden.
\-uuu aliases \-\-no\-ignore \-\-hidden \-\-text.
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-invert\-match
Invert matching.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-word\-regexp
Only show matches surrounded by word boundaries.
This is equivalent to putting \\b before and after the search pattern.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-line\-regexp
Only show matches surrounded by line boundaries.
This is equivalent to putting ^...$ around the search pattern.
.RS
.RE
.SH LESS COMMON OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-after\-context \f[I]NUM\f[]
Show NUM lines after each match.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-before\-context \f[I]NUM\f[]
Show NUM lines before each match.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-context \f[I]NUM\f[]
Show NUM lines before and after each match.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-colors \f[I]SPEC\f[] ...
This flag specifies color settings for use in the output.
This flag may be provided multiple times.
Settings are applied iteratively.
Colors are limited to one of eight choices: red, blue, green, cyan,
magenta, yellow, white and black.
Styles are limited to nobold, bold, nointense or intense.
.RS
.PP
The format of the flag is {type}:{attribute}:{value}.
{type} should be one of path, line, column or match.
{attribute} can be fg, bg or style.
Value is either a color (for fg and bg) or a text style.
A special format, {type}:none, will clear all color settings for {type}.
.PP
For example, the following command will change the match color to
magenta and the background color for line numbers to yellow:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rg\ \-\-colors\ \[aq]match:fg:magenta\[aq]\ \-\-colors\ \[aq]line:bg:yellow\[aq]\ foo.
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-column
Show column numbers (1 based) in output.
This only shows the column numbers for the first match on each line.
Note that this doesn\[aq]t try to account for Unicode.
One byte is equal to one column.
This implies \-\-line\-number.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-context\-separator \f[I]SEPARATOR\f[]
The string to use when separating non\-continuous context lines.
Escape sequences may be used.
[default: \-\-]
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-debug
Show debug messages.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-encoding \f[I]ENCODING\f[]
Specify the text encoding that ripgrep will use on all files searched.
The default value is \[aq]auto\[aq], which will cause ripgrep to do a
best effort automatic detection of encoding on a per\-file basis.
Other supported values can be found in the list of labels here:
https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept\-encoding\-get
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-file \f[I]FILE\f[] ...
Search for patterns from the given file, with one pattern per line.
When this flag is used or multiple times or in combination with the
\-e/\-\-regexp flag, then all patterns provided are searched.
Empty pattern lines will match all input lines, and the newline is not
counted as part of the pattern.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-files
Print each file that would be searched (but don\[aq]t search).
.RS
.PP
Combine with the \-g flag to return matched paths, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rg\ \-g\ \[aq]*.foo\[aq]\ \-\-files
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-files\-with\-matches
Only show path of each file with matches.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-files\-without\-match
Only show path of each file with no matches.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-with\-filename
Display the file name for matches.
This is the default when more than one file is searched.
If \-\-heading is enabled, the file name will be shown above clusters of
matches from each file; otherwise, the file name will be shown on each
match.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-no\-filename
Never show the filename for a match.
This is the default when one file is searched.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-heading
Show the file name above clusters of matches from each file instead of
showing the file name for every match.
This is the default mode at a tty.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-no\-heading
Don\[aq]t group matches by each file.
If \-H/\-\-with\-filename is enabled, then file names will be shown for
every line matched.
This is the default mode when not at a tty.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-hidden
Search hidden directories and files.
(Hidden directories and files are skipped by default.)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-iglob \f[I]GLOB\f[] ...
Include or exclude files/directories case insensitively.
This always overrides any other ignore logic if there is a conflict, but
is otherwise applied in addition to ignore files (e.g., .gitignore or
\&.ignore).
Multiple glob flags may be used.
Globbing rules match .gitignore globs.
Precede a glob with a \[aq]!\[aq] to exclude it.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-file \f[I]FILE\f[] ...
Specify additional ignore files for filtering file paths.
Ignore files should be in the gitignore format and are matched relative
to the current working directory.
These ignore files have lower precedence than all other ignore files.
When specifying multiple ignore files, earlier files have lower
precedence than later files.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-follow
Follow symlinks.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-max\-columns \f[I]NUM\f[]
Don\[aq]t print lines longer than this limit in bytes.
Longer lines are omitted, and only the number of matches in that line is
printed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-max\-count \f[I]NUM\f[]
Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to NUM.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-max\-filesize \f[I]NUM\f[]+\f[I]SUFFIX\f[]?
Ignore files larger than \f[I]NUM\f[] in size.
Directories will never be ignored.
.RS
.PP
\f[I]SUFFIX\f[] is optional and may be one of K, M or G.
These correspond to kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes respectively.
If omitted the input is treated as bytes.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-maxdepth \f[I]NUM\f[]
Descend at most NUM directories below the command line arguments.
A value of zero searches only the starting\-points themselves.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-mmap
Search using memory maps when possible.
This is enabled by default when ripgrep thinks it will be faster.
(Note that mmap searching doesn\[aq]t currently support the various
context related options.)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-no\-messages
Suppress all error messages.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-no\-mmap
Never use memory maps, even when they might be faster.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-no\-ignore
Don\[aq]t respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) This implies
\-\-no\-ignore\-parent.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-no\-ignore\-parent
Don\[aq]t respect ignore files in parent directories.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-no\-ignore\-vcs
Don\[aq]t respect version control ignore files (e.g., .gitignore).
Note that .ignore files will continue to be respected.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-0, \-\-null
Whenever a file name is printed, follow it with a NUL byte.
This includes printing filenames before matches, and when printing a
list of matching files such as with \-\-count, \-\-files\-with\-matches
and \-\-files.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-only\-matching
Print only the matched (non\-empty) parts of a matching line, with each
such part on a separate output line.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-path\-separator \f[I]SEPARATOR\f[]
The path separator to use when printing file paths.
This defaults to your platform\[aq]s path separator, which is / on Unix
and \\ on Windows.
This flag is intended for overriding the default when the environment
demands it (e.g., cygwin).
A path separator is limited to a single byte.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pretty
Alias for \-\-color=always \-\-heading \-\-line\-number.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-replace \f[I]ARG\f[]
Replace every match with the string given when printing search results.
Neither this flag nor any other flag will modify your files.
.RS
.PP
Capture group indices (e.g., $5) and names (e.g., $foo) are supported in
the replacement string.
.PP
Note that the replacement by default replaces each match, and NOT the
entire line.
To replace the entire line, you should match the entire line.
For example, to emit only the first phone numbers in each line:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rg\ \[aq]^.*([0\-9]{3}\-[0\-9]{3}\-[0\-9]{4}).*$\[aq]\ \-\-replace\ \[aq]$1\[aq]
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-case\-sensitive
Search case sensitively (default).
Overrides \-\-ignore\-case and \-\-smart\-case.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-smart\-case
Search case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase.
Search case sensitively otherwise.
This is overridden by either \-\-case\-sensitive or \-\-ignore\-case.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-sort\-files
Sort results by file path.
Note that this currently disables all parallelism and runs search in a
single thread.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-j, \-\-threads \f[I]ARG\f[]
The number of threads to use.
0 means use the number of logical CPUs (capped at 12).
[default: 0]
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show the version number of ripgrep and exit.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-vimgrep
Show results with every match on its own line, including line numbers
and column numbers.
With this option, a line with more than one match will be printed more
than once.
.RS
.PP
Recommended .vimrc configuration:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ set\ grepprg=rg\\\ \-\-vimgrep
\ \ set\ grepformat^=%f:%l:%c:%m
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Use :grep to grep for something, then :cn and :cp to navigate through
the matches.
.RE
.SH FILE TYPE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-type\-list
Show all supported file types and their associated globs.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-type\-add \f[I]ARG\f[] ...
Add a new glob for a particular file type.
Only one glob can be added at a time.
Multiple \-\-type\-add flags can be provided.
Unless \-\-type\-clear is used, globs are added to any existing globs
inside of ripgrep.
Note that this must be passed to every invocation of rg.
Type settings are NOT persisted.
Example:
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ rg\ \-\-type\-add\ \[aq]foo:*.foo\[aq]\ \-tfoo\ PATTERN
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\-\-type\-add can also be used to include rules from other types with
the special include directive.
The include directive permits specifying one or more other type names
(separated by a comma) that have been defined and its rules will
automatically be imported into the type specified.
For example, to create a type called src that matches C++, Python and
Markdown files, one can use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \-\-type\-add\ \[aq]src:include:cpp,py,md\[aq]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Additional glob rules can still be added to the src type by using the
\-\-type\-add flag again:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \-\-type\-add\ \[aq]src:include:cpp,py,md\[aq]\ \-\-type\-add\ \[aq]src:*.foo\[aq]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that type names must consist only of Unicode letters or numbers.
Punctuation characters are not allowed.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-type\-clear \f[I]TYPE\f[] ...
Clear the file type globs previously defined for TYPE.
This only clears the default type definitions that are found inside of
ripgrep.
Note that this must be passed to every invocation of rg.
